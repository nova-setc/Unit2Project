          <h2>Robots in the 20th Century</h2>
          <p>
            In the early 1900s, robotics as a field of study truly took off.
            From further development of remote-control technology, to computers as we might
            think of them today, the rate of development was increasing exponentially.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the 1960s, humans had created robots to assist with industrial manufacturing tasks,
            and even a full-scale, intelligent humanoid robot!

            WABOT-1, pictured here was the first full-size, intelligent humanoid 
            robot. WABOT-1 could walk, talk, carry things, and had functioning
            sensory receptors somewhat like eyes and ears.

          <h2>Modern-Day Robots</h2>
          <p>
            As the study and application of robotics has continued to improve, more and more
            robots have been created to perform tasks that humans may not be able to do (or do as well),
            and tasks that may be considered less-than-desirable by humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Robots as we know them today can assist in (or in some cases, fully perform) manufacturing,
            allow for better accuracy and higher success rates in medical procedures, and help to 
            upkeep a home by vacuuming, mowing the lawn, and folding laundry.
