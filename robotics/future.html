          <h2>Emerging Technologies in Robotics</h2>
          <p>
            This page showcases some of the robotic technologies currently in development. These 
            technologies are not yet widely available, but prototypes exist and are actively being
            improved. It is more than likely that some of these technologies will become commonplace
            in our lifetime.

            <h3>Soft Robotics</h3>
            <img src="images/soft-robotics.png" alt="a robot octopus made of soft tissue">
            <figcaption>
              Soft robotics is the creation of robots out of flexible materials to mimic
              living tissue. This allows the robots to handle more fragile items, and seem
              more lifelike. This technology is likely to be applied in healthcare, and may
              eventually be applied to android technology, allowing the androids to seem more
              similar to humans.

            <h3>Swarm Robotics</h3>
            <img src="images/swarm-robotics.jpg" alt="a group of many small robots on a flat surface" class="desktop">
            <figcaption>
              Swarm robotics is based on the behavior of social insects such as ants or bees. Though
              the average person is unlikely to have use for this type of robot system in their 
              everyday life, this field will have a major impact on industries such as agriculture,
              medical, and military.

            <h3>Medical Robotics</h3>
            <img src="images/medical-robotics.jpg" alt="a robotic arm simulating performing a medical procedure" class="half-height desktop">
            <figcaption>
              Medical robots are already in use, to some extent, by medical providers to much of the 
              general public. Continued advancements in this field will allow higher rates of success
              during medical procedures, less invasive procedures, and more easily accessible medical 
              care. Medical robotics is bolstered by several other fields of robotics, whose discoveries 
              can often be adjusted and re-applied to suit the medical field.

            <h3>Humanoid Robotics</h3>
            <img src="images/humanoid-robotics.jpg" alt="a portrait of a robot with a human-like face">
            <figcaption>
              Androids (also known as humanoid robots) have long been a desire of those interested in 
              robotics. Already models exist which can mimic human movement, speech, and other actions. 
              As other robotics fields advance (particularly soft robotics) these machines become more and 
              more lifelike. Future applications as these robots become more readily available include
              customer service, education, and companionship.
