          <h2>What makes a robot?</h2>
          <p>
            When we think of the word "robot", we often think of what might more
            accurately be referred to as an android (a robot resembling a human, often designed to
            assist humans in daily activities).
          </p>
          <p>
            In reality, any machine which performs automated
            tasks can be considered a robot.

          <h2>Robots are not just science-fiction</h2>
          <p>
            While robots may bring to mind the stuff of novels, movies, or television,
            the first robot was actually invented around 420 BCE. That's well over 2000 years ago!
          </p>
          <p>
            There are even robots present in many houses today! Though automated vacuums can
            seem perfectly ordinary to us now, only a few decades ago, such a thing would have
            seemed a distant future.
          </p>
          <p>
            While personal assistance androids seen in popular media such as the video game 
            "Detroit: Become Human" do not exist in our current time, the future may be closer
            than we think.
          </p>
          <p>
            Browse this website to learn more about the history of robotics, and where we may
            be headed next.
